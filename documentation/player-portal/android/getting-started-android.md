This guide will walk you through the steps for adding a Kaltura video player to your Android mobile application, using the Kaltura Player. The library is a super-collection of all Kaltura Playkit libraries, which include the [Player](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-android), Kaltura [Analytics](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-android-kava), and various [Providers](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-android-providers) that can access the Kaltura Backend. Using the Kaltura Player library makes it easier to take advantage of all player capabilities. 

In this Kotlin tutorial,  you'll learn how to import the Kaltura Player SDK, find the necessary credentials, and load the player with your Entry ID of choice. **Because the player is focused on performance and giving you the simplest integration possible, it does not contain a UI.** That being said, this guide will show you how to listen to events in order to manage the player state, as well as examples for adding play/pause buttons and a slider to the player.
