## Supported Analytics for iOS SDK 

Kalturaâ€™s Mobile Video Player SDKs for iOS make it easy for you to integrate analytics data collection, by providing you with several analytics solutions.

>**Important**: Best practice for using analytics is to register plugins in the `AppDelegate` file.

## Youbora Plugin  

This section describes the steps required for implementing the Youbora Plugin on iOS devices. Youbora is an intelligence analytics and optimization platform used in Kaltura's solution to track media analytics events. 

You'll need to set up an account in http://www.youbora.com and then set the account details in the plugin configuration to use this plugin. After these steps, you'll be able to use the Youbora dashboard and watch statistical events and analytics sent by the Kaltura Video Payer.

For additional information on the YouboraPlugin options dictionary refer to their [developer portal](http://developer.nicepeopleatwork.com/plugins/general/setting-youbora-options/).

### Getting Started with the Youbora Plugin  

To enable the Youbora Stats Plugin on iOS devices for the Kaltura Video Player, add the following line to your Podfile: 

```ruby
pod 'PlayKit/YouboraPlugin'
```

#### Register Plugin

```swift
PlayKitManager.shared.registerPlugin(YouboraPlugin.self)
```

#### Create a Config and Load Player

```swift
// config options
let youboraOptions: [String: Any] = [
    "accountCode": "nicetest" // mandatory
    // YouboraPlugin.enableSmartAdsKey: true - use this if you want to enable smart ads
]
// create analytics config with the created params
let youboraConfig = AnalyticsConfig(params: youboraOptions)
// create config dictionary
let config = [YouboraPlugin.pluginName: youboraConfig]
// create plugin config object
let pluginConfig = PluginConfig(config: config)
// load the player with the created plugin config
let player = PlayKitManager.shared.loadPlayer(pluginConfig: pluginConfig)
```

>Note: Only now load the player with the Plugin Config.

## OTT Stats Plugin Info  

This section provides additional information on the OTT Stats plugin.

### OTT Stats Plugin Supported Events  

The OTT Stats Plugins (Phoenix, TVPAPI) supports the following events:

```swift
enum OTTAnalyticsEventType: String {
    case hit
    case play
    case stop
    case pause
    case firstPlay
    case swoosh
    case load
    case finish

self.playerController.addObserver(self, events: [OttEvent.concurrency]) { event in
    // handle concurrency event
}                   
```
